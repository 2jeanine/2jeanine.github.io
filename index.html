      <p class="description">Hello everyone.  Thanks for taking a look at Ruby Boots.  This is my first attempt at building a website since starting at Devbootcamp just two weeks ago.  I made the move from marketing and
      corporate branding to learning to build code to become a web programmer.  I used to think I had some
      concept of time managment and what being a student would involve.  But I was very mistaken.  I am
      just now getting some idea of how to learn and use my time well.  Which is good, because over the next several weeks I'm going to need it.  The Fiddler Crabs are on the way.  I can only imagine where we will go from here.</p>
