  <h1>Disarm a Stereotype Threat</h1>

      When I applied to Dev Bootcamp I knew unequivocally that I was passionate about and committed to learning to program.  But there was also this nagging confirmation of a feeling of hesitation to pursuing this goal because of what I had assessed as four inherent barriers to entering into and succeeding in an immersive academic program focusing on technology instruction.  These perceived barriers included my gender (female), my age (over 40), my complete lack of previous programming experience, and finally, my background in art which accelerated and developed my propensity for "visual" learning.  Initially, I thought this frame of mind was part environmental but also a personal conclusion about myself.  But then as I read several of the articles by Claude Steele and watched his Columbia University lecture video about "stereotype threat" I realized that this is an intellectual predicament that I am subjecting myself to that stems from societal perceptions.

      Because of these four concerns regarding my gender, age, lack of experience, and educational background I have perceived myself to be pigeonholed into an underrepresented group and that I would be viewed by others and was viewing myself negatively.  I was fearing that I would confirm this stereotype threat.  And if I allowed myself to be defined by this the result would be a distraction from concentration, underperformance and lack of achievement.  But this information from Claude Steele has enlightened me to ask, I can harness my diversity and not let it affect my ability to focus and participate?  And further, how do I avoid the anxiety that could impact my efforts to use my cognitive resources to disarm stereotype threat that could undermine my goals.

      I recognize that a preoccupation with a perceived social pyschological predicament will manifest itself through a self-evaluative threat that is disruptive to my intended depth of learning.  So the solution is to address this issue.  Half the battle of any problem is to meet it head on.  I shouldn't allow myself to create or internalize an inferiority panic but to understand the perception of stereotype threat exists if I subject myself to it.  Claude Steele and others have identified this experience and shown it can be mitigated rather than become a distraction and impediment to growth and progress.

      I also believe that another tool to disarming stereotype threat is the immersion not only in the dev bootcamp education but in the core philosophy.  Dev bootcamp focuses on a broader, deeper approach to learning that takes into account the students overall state of mind as it may impact proper understanding.  So by generating a discussion about stereotype threat, as well as the fixed vs. growth mindset I am provided with the an awareness that I can overcome and disarm these concerns.
