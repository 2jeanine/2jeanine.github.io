  <h1>Ask a Silly Question</h1>

      As I have transitioned through each week of Phase 0 at devbootcamp I have come to understand how beneficial it is to ask questions.  Lots of questions.  I don't think I was ever as aware as I am now that something as simple as a question can lead to powerful answers that can bring you knowledge but also point in directions of learning that I never considered.  And, further, I learned that the key to receiving substantive information and the answers I was searching for, was to ask the better question in the optimum way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first starting harnessing the broad range of the world wide web and google in particular I did not format my question(s) adequately and I was receiving suggestions for resources that were often far removed from what I intended.
      What was wrong with google I thought?  It couldn't possibly be me!?  Or was it?   But then as I continued my quest for information and learning it dawned on me that I was the source of my own frustration. I was I getting silly answers because I kept asking silly questions? The answer to that question was yes.  Then I had a little "aha" moment.  I made the connection between the dbc instruction that feedback should be "specific", "actionable", and "kind" and applied that to my questions.  And that led to the nexus to the challenge READme page where it reminds us to break the problem down.  So that became my approach to getting the right information.  Take the time to communicate my
      question(s) effectively.  Break down my problem and piece together a solid question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found that a concise, well-worded question made all the difference.  If I used unique keywords relating to the
      particular topic I was unfamiliar with I would be pointed in the right, if not, the exact direction addressing my needs.
      And that specialized information was generally so abundant it led to more comprehension and far less confusion and frustration.  And it showed me that I was repsonsible for finding what I was looking for because it was there.  The problem previously was I didn't know how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another benefit of asking the better question was that I came to view Ruby Docs, RubyLearning, Stack Overflow, to name a few, as a valuable source of information.  The more I used these resources that my questions directed me to the less I viewed them as daunting pages of indecipherable documentation.  Instead they were helping hands.  They encourged me to formulate ideas, consider options, take a leap, test code.  It never occured to me that some contributions to online coding blogs might be nonworking code.  Then one day I was looking at some code on a blog site similar to what I was searching for.  I ran the code and it was full of error messages.  Wait, you mean there's bad code on the internet?  That made me feel a little naive.  But it was good because I was able to see what was wrong, correct it, and make it work.  Which really hit home to always, always remember to run the tests.
    </p>

      And finally, I was enlightened to the wonderful fact that within the programming community there are many knowledgeable people who are generous with their time and talents and willing to help greener than green
      newbies like me start on their journey to learning to learn programming the right way.  So thank you for this
      opportunity and the resources to find the solutions and answers to my many, many questions.
