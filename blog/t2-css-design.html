        What makes for a successful website is delivering performance and a meaningful user experience.  A web designer’s goal is for the internet user to find the website appealing, accessible, and enjoyable.  This can be achieved by selecting the right design elements but more importantly, by the how those elements compliment one another and combine to build a cohesive, well-balanced end product.  The intent is a synchronicity of design, form, and function.  Underneath the color, images, icons, land links is a critical approach to positioning.

      A good web designer lays the foundation for the website by strategically coordinating and arranging the skeleton of the page.  This will support the design features to maximize their effect on the user.  Effective structure on a web page requires a skillful approach to the use of the positioning elements - margin, border, and padding.  This trio contributes to the display property and it’s unity is expressed in a format known as the “box model”  I have included a photo that will enable you to visualize how a web designer uses this tool to craft a successful website.  The content is , of course, the thrust of the web page whether it is an idea, a product, or service.  That content is is nested, or surrounded, in the padding, the padding is nested in the border.  And the margin is on the periphery encloses everything.  These features are selected, or not, based on the desired layout of the page to promote the creation, and presentation of  a dynamic web experience.  The margin, padding, and border can set the desired tone and build cohesion.

        The intent of the positioning is twofold.  To enable the designer to interact efficiently during the testing and maintenance of functionality and editing.  And to achieve the optimal prolonged user experience.
