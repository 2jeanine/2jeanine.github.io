      I've had conversations with many people that have found themselves in the unfortunate and difficult position of working for someone that seems to thrive on conflict.  An employment situation presents a different set of challenges when attempting to resolve that conflict compared to a conflict with a friend or family member.  Because there is an established hierarchy in the workplace the playing field is not even and fair and reasonable behavior may be the expectation but is often not the reality.  As a result, because a person has authority over another and that authority may include having an impact on job security, advancement opportunity, compensation increase, etc... it is imperative
      to be thoughtful and careful when attempting to resolve conflict.  The determination to seek resolution is usually because the behvior is serious, counter productive, pervasive, and/or having a prolonged impact on company morale.
      And since conflict is a part of life developing conflict resolution skills will serve a person well.  The alternative is to find a new employer to separate yourself from the conflict but there is no guarantee you won't leave one difficult situtation and walk into a new worse one.  Because, unfortuantely during the interview process a potential employer doesn't inform you, "Oh, by the way, I'm a total ass to work for".  And that is exactly the type of person I found myself encountering and reporting to on the job, which wasn't inititally apparent.

      My position in marketing and branding was structured such that, as a manager, I was assigned a particular geographic territory and worked out of a home office most of the time.  The corporate offices were based on the East coast and there was no local office in California.  Generally, I was responsible for participating in the coordination and execution of product campaigns, cultivating client account relationships, securing contracts, hiring employees to execute specific duties per the contracts, and maintaining electronic employee files. One of the executives I reported to lived in Central California while I reside in Northern California and we didn't interact face-to-face often.  As long as I met deadlines and fulfilled my job repsonsibilities I had a degree of autonomy and flexibility.  On the occassions we did speak or meet I found him to be rigid, demanding, negative, emotional and self-possessed.  I worked at being perceptive and prepared so whatever was discussed regarding my performance and contracts would convey the status quo was being maintained and there was no cause for alarm.  And the beast was kept calm.

    <p>
      But each quarter I was part of a travel rotation throughout the United States to meet and work with other managers and staff to test the prototype of new ideas and implement the target locations.  Most of the time I traveled to the East coast leaving very early in the morning to fly out per a specific itinerary scheduled by the home office.  We usually
      started with a breakfast meeting early the next day which meant, with the time differnce,  I was usually jet-lagged and groggy because my brain didn't understand why I was trying to talk and eat at 3:30 in the morning.   On one of these rotations, I found myself spending a week with this executive.  Meeting with someone above you in the company occassionally and being together morning, noon, and night is vastly different as I realized within twenty-four hours.  In addition, since he was the top rung of the ladder during this project, that seem to contribute to what unfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after breakfast on day one of the project from hell we proceeded on to meet with our first client of the week.  The parameters of the project were discussed and the client made a number of demands as expected.  And since our presence is usually the result of a corporate decision above our client's authority we are generally perceived as an
      unavoidable intrusion.  Some clients are more accomodating then others as they realize their cooperation means improved productivity on our part and a smoother, faster project conclusion.  The client departed and we started our project. The executive from my company started out in a bad mood and it got worse.   He delegated responsibilities and distributed document specifications binders for the project.  When we reviewed them it was apparent they were for another project and could not be utilized for this one.  When that was pointed out he took back these large, heavy binders and started throwing them over our heads and screaming.  It would have made a great youtube video to catch the expressions on our faces as we looked at each other and ducked for cover.  Who behaves like that, in public especially?  Then he stormed off.  I was blown away but some of the others were not beacause they had experienced similar behavior before.  My previous rotations had not paired us together within a group.  After having a group discussion and some "can you believe thats",  we were able to start the project and make some calls to get a fax delivery of what we needed.  The week was awful as bad behavior to some degree continued.   We often had meals together during when each of us was the target of jokes or ridicule unrelated to our jobs. It was a relief when the week ended and we all flew home.  But it didn't end there.

      The compamy has an annonymous hotline to enable employees to report violations of company policy and procedure
      or anything they feel should be addressed.  During my next travel rotation there was an unexpected addition at the
      morning meeting who I did not recognize.  I had been delegated team captain and had received the list of names of
      my team and this person was not on that list.  Before we sat down for our meeting I walked over to introduce myslef while everyone was chatting and trying to wake up.  The person informed me they were from human resources at corporate headquarters and we were going to discuss some reports they had recieved.   I was blindsided.  They went on to mention the name of the executive as well as another who displayed equally bad behavior.  I was asked numerous questions.  I answered carefully because the flow of the conversation made it clear one or both of these people were going to be demoted or terminated.  And that is what happened.  I was pulled in to corporate conflict
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in this instance, I learned, that sometimes conflict resolution is forced on you.  I also realized that you may be
      accountable for behavor you assume others are unaware of.  And I was actually grateful because following the bad travel experience I had started to formulate the discussion I was going to have the next time we worked together.
      My position has involved performance reviews for people I hired.  But talking with someone I report to about poor
      behavior that is contrary to company policy would be difficult.    But if I avoided it all of us might have had to continue
      to jump out of the way of flying objects in the workplace.    And who knows how much worse it may have become!
