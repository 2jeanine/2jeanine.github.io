  <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>
  <h2>We're also pairing with technology</h2>

      I have to say I do have mixed feelings about pairing and feedback.  Primarily I think the experience of working with other DBC students is beneficial.  While pairing we have the opportunity to address the Challenges together to exchange ideas and compare our interpretation and understanding of how to build toward completion.  Pairing can confirm proper understanding of a competency or the need for further learning.  I have had pairing partners where our skill-set was similar which resulted in a pairing session with open communication, a constructive work flow, and a balanced exchange of knowledge.  We each contributed something we had learned that the other was not familiar with.  I have also had pairing partners who had a less of an understanding of the competence necessary for the Challenge than I did which meant I needed to be able to communicate clearly and effectively.   So the focus becomes the skill of articulation which can be a significant factor in pairing. This is when I would mention the additional resources I found helpful.  And I have had pairing sessions where I did not have proper understanding of the competence and appreciated if my partner was able to build my comprehension or I became frustrated if they rushed through the code and expected their skill-set to match mine.
      In the end I have become aware that each pairing session is a new experience that requires awareness, concentration, consideration and constructive particpation.

      Feedback has been work in progress.  I have made an effort to balance my feedback as Specific, Actionable, and Kind.  But for some Challenges that is more easily accomplished  than others.  As some exercises are clear while others are vague.
      I am also not as comfortable giving more critical feedback even if it is reasonable from say a pairing partner who said they didn't understand the competence at all and stated I was explaining it well.  I have received feedback that showed areas I need improvement and that confirmed my own self-assessment during our pairing session.Or pointed out something I was not aware and needed to address.  Seeing the range of types of feedback has helped solidify what constitutes the parameters of "Specific", Actionable", and "Kind".

      What I find awkward about pairing is navigating the general technology.  That computers can be unreliable, and unpredictable.  There can be power surges, or outages.  The audio can lag or be intermittent.  That faces and voices are not synchronized.  And I find irb too small at times because my monitor is not large.
      All this can impact the ability to concentrate and engage with your partner(s) and detract from the learning experience.
