  <h1>Tech Issues</h1>
  <h2>Why is the bar so low?</h2>
  <h4>December 14, 2014</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Perched in this technology driven 21st century where our lives continue to be
      impacted, improved, and accelerated by the exponential growth and development within the computer industry I have assumed that the majority of
      programmers employed today are competent and knowledgeable.  What did I
      know?!
    </p>
    <p>
      What I have been reading lately has emphasized that a critical issue within the
      tech industry is that many programmers do not have minimal programming skills,
      and cannot even write basic code but somehow are employed.  While certainly
      there are competent, and even enormously talented programmers in the tech industry today, current data would suggest this is the exception to the rule.  How
      does someone with an engineering, computer science, and/or advanced degree
      not possess the ability to contribute as expected?  How did they get hired?  Does something need to change to confirm a programmer can actually write code?
   </p>
   <p>
      While they are obviously good programmers who are making the internet and tech industry as awesome as it is why aren't there enough?  All you have to do is
      listen to the feedback to realize demand far outweighs supply.  As a result there is a critical issue of programming jobs being filled by people lacking proper
      understanding and ability to execute programming competencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One blog post on the internet I recently read <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">coding horrors</a>, expands on the
      opinion of far too many employed underskilled programmers. The author of the
      blog, Jeff Atwood, mentions the use of a children's game popular in the UK called "FizzBuzz", that has been used to test the competency of potential hires
      during the interview process.  The interviewee is asked to write the relatively
      simple code to properly play the game FizzBuzz.  The findings were that  a
      number of programmers and engineers could not accomplish this:
    </p>
      <div class="map_code">
      <pre>
        <code>
          numbers = (1..100).to_a
          numbers.each do |number|
            if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0
              puts "fizzbuzz"
            elsif number % 3 == 0
              puts "fizz"
            elsif number % 5 == 0
              puts "buzz"
            else
              puts number
            end
          end
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
     <p>
        This supports the opinion that there is a tech issue of a disconnect between the educational paradigm and corporate requisites; and have revealed that the criteria for determing a programmers skill is not adequate.
