            <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    Pair programming is a seemingly simple concept where two people work together from the same
                    or different locations to complete a programming project.  They work collaboratively, each
                    contributing ideas and effort but there is a specific structure wherein they trade off roles
                    of participation.  One of the pair expresses ideas and directions for the type of code, format,
                    etc... while the other of the pair executes and implements those ideas.  Then after a set
                    amount of time they trade roles and continue to complete the programming project.  The structure
                    itself encourages a willingness to be flexible, open-minded and self-assessing. Pair programming
                    builds an awareness of self as part of a whole, and  clarifies individual behavior as it relates
                    to, and impacts the achievement of a shared programming project.
                </p>
            <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
                <p>
                    Pair programming is important to DBC because when you are particpating in an immersive, intensive
                    educational curriculm it is neccessary to eliminate redundancy, optimize data absorption with
                    proper understanding, and cultivate an intellecutal synchronicity that motivates and engages
                    students.  Effective pair programming builds learning momentum through a shared mindset that
                    highlights each individual's contribution toward a mutual outcome.  Since one may learn or
                    processes information differently, or more quickly (or slowly) than another pair programming
                    can accomplish filling in the gaps that may slow comprehension.  As well as build a sense of
                    social consciousness.

            <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
                <p>
                    During the pair programming the partners take on the roles of halves of the whole.  One of pair
                    is Driver while the other of the pair is Navigator.  And then they switch roles.  The driver is
                    the person on the keyboard, searching for resource information, saving files, etc... while the
                    navigator is guiding the driver as to what code should be written, in which language and to what
                    end.  During these roles there can be an exchange of input and ideas so the programming goals are
                    acheived and the partners have a optimally beneficial experience and the best code is written.
